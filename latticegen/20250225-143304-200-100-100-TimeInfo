q-ary basis [[I_(n-k) H], [0 q*I_k] ], n = 200, k = 100. Enteries are randomly in [0,100b]. 
 If char is 'b', then it first samples an integer q of bit-length b; if char is 'p', it does the same and updates q to the smallest (probabilistic) prime that is greater; if char is 'q', then it sets q to the provided value. It returns a 2 x 2 block matrix [[I, H], [0, q*I]], where H is (d-k) x k and uniformly random modulo q. These bases correspond to the SIS/LWE q-ary lattices (see [MR09]). Goldstein-Mayer lattices correspond to k=1 and q prime (see [GM03]).
